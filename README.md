# Pratical task

You will find scripts and Markdown files here. The project is organized with the following hierachy:

**Working directory**
* *Data* includes the raw data for the assignment. For certain projects it makes sense to include two seperate directories, i.e., *Data_raw* and *Data_clean*. This is usually not part of the Git version control.
* *Documents* has any additional documentation or drafts. Also usually not part of the Get version control.
* *Figures* includes the figures produced during the assignment. Also usually not part of the Get version control.
* *Markdown* contains Markdown files and their .html rendering of the project. This is typically part of the Git version control.
* *Scripts* contains the seperate scripts for the analysis. Always part of the Git version control.
